              <div class="post-content">
                  <p>During our Japan trip in May 2023, I was really keen to take part in a Tea Ceremony. To save rushing around in Kyoto, I booked us a Tea Ceremony Workshop at Shizu-Kokoro in Tokyo, on our first full day.</p>
                  <p>It was really great; the teacher spoke perfect English, was very friendly, and explained everything she was doing in a clear way. Taking part was just us and another couple from Denmark who were at the end of their trip to Japan.</p>
                  <p>We were given sakuracha (cherry blossom tea) to drink when we arrived, and then watched a quick video about the origins of chado (tea ceremony).</p>
                  <p>We took off our shoes to go upstairs to the tea room, and sat on the floor. There was a scroll on the wall with a zen saying (possibly <em>ichi-go ichi-e</em>, 'one time one meeting' / 'newness in every encounter'), and the ceremony equipment at the front.</p>
                  <div class="pure-g">
                    <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/xh361xC/sakuracha.jpg" alt="cherry blossom tea (sakura-cha)"></div>
                    <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/f4WzSHM/scroll.jpg" alt="zen scroll, ichi-go ichi-e"></div>
                  </div>
                <p>We ate our first sweets of day, and she told us a bit about the teaware (it is purposefully plainly coloured, to not distract from the ceremony), how the ceremony would work, when to bow, what to do when we are given our cup, how to compliment the host... then performed the ceremony for us. It was very precise and delicate, really lovely.</p>
                <p>I got the first cup; it was placed in front of me and we bowed, then I picked it up with my right hand, placed it on my left palm, rotated the cup two quarter turns to face the 'best part of the cup' towards the host (this could be a different coloured section, or visable kintsugi), bowed again and then drank.</p>
                <div class="pure-g">
                  <div class="pure-u-1-2"><img class="pure-img-responsive-border" src="https://i.ibb.co/dgYP8cG/sweet.jpg" alt="namagashi sweet shaped like a rose"></div>

                </div>
                <p>It was very thick, hard to get out of the cup, but quite nice and not bitter.</p>
                <p>She spoke to us a bit more about tea and about the matcha bowls (they were Rakuyaki, from Kyoto), and then we prepared a cup of matcha for each other (thin tea, so more water in the cup). We chose a bowl for each other (these were more decorative ones, for a less formal ceremony), then whisked the tea to make it foamy.</p>

                <p>I would highly recommend booking in at Shizu-Kokoro if in Tokyo. I had intended to do another tea ceremony in Kyoto as well, but we didn't get time so I'm very glad that we did this one early!</p>
